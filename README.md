# Huffman-Code
Algorithm and Data Huffman code

The main cpp program is the one containing the final suffix. Its a cpp code for the Huffman algorithm that codes and decodes in a single run. There is a docx with a little explanation, and why I used each library.

There is also a folder with some others people code that i found online to base my programm.
